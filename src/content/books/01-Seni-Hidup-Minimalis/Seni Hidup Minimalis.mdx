Francine Jay’s _Seni Hidup Minimalis_ offers a clear, refreshing, and practical guide to living a minimalist lifestyle. It’s not just about organizing stuff—it’s a more mindful and simple approach to life. Known as “Miss Minimalist,” Jay’s writing feels warm and freeing—inviting us to live lighter without guilt or pressure. This book is super helpful, especially if you’ve just moved into a new home or are excited to tidy up but don’t know where to start.

Instead of just giving storage hacks or organizing tips, Jay focuses on a mindset shift: from hoarding to appreciating, from having more to needing just enough. Her signature method, STREAMLINE, becomes the heart of the book—and it’s easy to remember and actually apply.

## 🧘‍♀️ Key Takeaways:

### 1. Start with the Mindset: Minimalism Is a Way of Life

Minimalism isn’t just about throwing stuff away—it’s about realizing what really matters and letting go of the rest. It’s not some once-in-a-while cleaning spree, but a more intentional way to live. Personally, now whenever I want to buy something, I ask myself: do I really need this? Or is it just a random craving?

### 2. The STREAMLINE Method

Jay introduces the acronym **STREAMLINE** as a step-by-step guide for decluttering:

-   **S**: **Start over** – Empty the space first so you can see everything you actually own.
    
-   **T**: **Trash, treasure, or transfer** – Sort every item: throw it out, keep it, or give it away.
    
-   **R**: **Reason for each item** – Ask why you own it—does it still serve a purpose in your life?
    
-   **E**: **Everything in its place** – Make sure everything you keep has a designated spot.
    
-   **A**: **All surfaces clear** – Keep tables, counters, and shelves tidy for a calmer vibe.
    
-   **M**: **Modules** – Group things in small, neat, and manageable units.
    
-   **L**: **Limits** – Set physical boundaries (like one drawer or one shelf) to avoid piling up again.
    
-   **I**: **If one comes in, one goes out** – Buy something new? Then let something go.
    
-   **N**: **Narrow it down** – Be picky. Less stuff, more meaning.
    
-   **E**: **Every day** – Minimalism is a habit, not a one-time event.

### 3. Declutter by Category

Instead of tackling a whole room, Jay suggests starting with categories—like clothes, books, or gadgets. It’s less overwhelming and way more focused.

----------

### 4. Minimalism Is Personal

There’s no magic number for how much stuff you “should” own. Everyone’s needs and preferences are different. What matters is being intentional—only keeping things that truly support your life and bring you joy.
