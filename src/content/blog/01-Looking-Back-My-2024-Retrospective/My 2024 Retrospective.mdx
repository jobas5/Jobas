I started this blog after seeing a reel about the concept of a “second brain.” It made me think — we often forget memories we thought we’d never lose. The small moments fade, even when we try to hold onto them. So here I am, documenting my year — not just for you, but also for future me.

## ✨ How 2024 Went

2024 was a breakthrough year. A mix of first-times and last-times, milestones and memories. Here are some of the highlights:

----------

### 👨‍💻 **Interning as an Android Developer at a Startup**

I never imagined doing this internship in my final year. A lecturer — also a friend from my tech community — encouraged me to apply. It turned out to be the perfect opportunity to go deep into Android development, something I’d only scratched the surface of before.

----------

### 📚 **Mentoring in Bangkit 2024 (Batch 2)**

I was honored to serve as a Machine Learning Mentor in Bangkit — a program host by Dicoding and led by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka. Guiding passionate students was one of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had. Their hunger to learn reminded me why I started in tech in the first place.


----------

### 🧑‍💼 **Landing My First Full-Time Job**

I had planned to start my career in Surabaya, where I graduated. But my mom wanted me closer to home — so I took a leap and looked for jobs in Batam. One month later, I landed a role, and I’m grateful for how things turned out.

----------

### ✈️ **First Time Traveling Abroad**

Three months into my job, I got the opportunity to present our AI-integrated product to our regional HQ in Singapore. It was my first international trip and my first time representing something I helped build.

----------

## 😅 What Didn't Go So Well

Not everything was smooth. Some things changed in ways I didn’t expect.

----------

### 🤯 **Adulthood Is Harder Than Expected**

In college, I could explore anything I wanted. Now, every decision takes thought, time, and sometimes sacrifice. I’ve started to understand what people mean when they talk about the weight of adult life.

----------

### 👨🏿‍🤝‍👨🏽 **Missing My Old Life & Friends**

I still hang out with my high school friends in Batam, but I miss the chaos and laughter of my college “kontrakan” days. Life used to feel lighter. I worry I’m losing touch with the people who shaped me.

----------

### 🧠 **Wearing Too Many Hats at Work**

I’m currently a solo AI Engineer and also handling QA in my company. With no senior to learn from and no junior to delegate to, I’ve had to grow fast — sometimes too fast.

----------

### 🌀 **Twenties Chaos: Everyone’s on a Different Path**

Some friends are getting promoted, some are getting married, others feel lost or lonely. Our lives are all going in different directions, and it’s hard not to compare.

## 🧭 My 2024 Personal Takeaways

- Sometimes, the best opportunities come from people who believe in you. Listen to them — they often see your potential before you do.
- Teaching isn’t just about giving — it’s also about growing. When you share what you know, you discover how much more there is to learn.
- Your career doesn’t always follow your map. Sometimes detours — especially for family — lead you exactly where you’re meant to be.
- Big things happen when you’re willing to say yes to growth. Keep building — people will notice.
- Freedom doesn’t disappear — it just evolves. You still get to explore; now you just need to plan your path more carefully.
- Friendships need effort to survive adulthood. Make space for old connections — they remind you of who you are.
- Being thrown in the deep end is scary, but it forces you to swim. You’ll be amazed at what you’re capable of.
- Your timeline is your own. Trust your pace, and don’t let comparison distract you from your path.


## 🧭 Looking Ahead

This year taught me that growth doesn’t always feel good — sometimes it feels like confusion, exhaustion, and fear. But it’s still growth.

In 2025, I hope to continue sharing, documenting, and reflecting more — not just for memory, but for meaning.
